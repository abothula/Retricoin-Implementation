# Retricoin-Implementation :- 
  
 "Retricoin is an improvisation of Bitcoin" .
 "Retricoin" is a cryptocurrency that relies on Proof of retrievability for approving transactions . 
                  ("Bitcoin") is a fully decentralized electronic cash system. "Retricoin" is the scheme(CryptoCurrency) which replaces the heavy computational proof-of-work of "Bitcoin" by proofs of retrievability that have practical benefits.Every user who wants to mine Bitcoins must store a considerable portion of this file and prove their storage to other peers in the network using proofs of retrievability. An algorithm was made to let the miners in a group(pool) mine collectively.The progress can be still made in the code. Since work is still being continued, the code has been kept confidential.
